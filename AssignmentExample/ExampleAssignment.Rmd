## In yours, please anonymise everything. 

## Question 01: 
### What is the reproducibility crisis in science and should we care?

Here is my written answer.

## Question 02: 
### Create a figure using the Palmer Penguin dataset that is correct but badly communicates the data.

Here is my terrible figure. I made the figure, saved it to a file `bad_figure.jpg`, and now I am embedding it in this file. I use the following markdown code to embed an image file:

`![](bad_figure.jpg)`

If my image was saved in a `figures` folder, then the path inside would be:

`![](figures/bad_figure.jpg)`


![](bad_figure.jpg)

If I prefer I can have the code in an rmd cell and it makes the plot underneath. The code will not be marked so I can have it in the rmd file but make sure it doesn't show up in the html/pdf. I started my r code cell block with:

` ```{r pseudo-code, echo=FALSE}`

Where `echo=FALSE` means the code will not be shown in the resulting html/pdf, but the resulting figure will be:

```{r pseudo-code, echo=FALSE}
# Some pseudo code that isn't in the final html document. 

#plot_flipper_figure <- function(penguins_flippers){
#  penguins_flippers %>% 
#    ggplot(aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm)) +
#    geom_boxplot(aes(color = species), width = 0.3, show.legend = FALSE) +
#    geom_jitter(aes(color = species), alpha = 0.3, show.legend = FALSE, 
#                position = position_jitter(width = 0.2, seed = 0)) +
#    scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
#    scale_x_discrete(labels=c("Adelie","Chinstrap","Gentoo")) +
#    labs(x = "Penguin Species",
#         y = "Flipper length (mm)") +
#    theme_bw()
#}

#flipper_boxplot <- plot_flipper_figure(penguins_flippers)
plot(pressure)

```


Here is my written answer about the figure -- which will be marked. 

## Question 03: 
### Discuss how colour choice is important for communication in science figures and what considerations should be made

Here is my written answer. 

## Question 04: 
### Run a statistical test on the Palmer Penguins dataset and produce a figure to explain it.

Here is the url to my github repo containing the rmd file or multiple R files with my code in it and the figures etc.

## Question 05: 
### Download someone else's example from Question 04 and review your thoughts

Here is my partner's Github repo:
